This repository contains the final project for BMIN503: Data Science for Biomedical Informatics. The project evaluates whether a SmartForm-derived red-flag scoring system for pediatric headache encounters aligns with clinician neurology referral behavior. Using structured “red flag” inputs collected across a pediatric primary care network, the analysis examines referral patterns, score-based recommendations, concordance with actual provider actions, and logistic regression models predicting referral decisions.
This project contains files for my qmd, HTML and the figures created.
