This repository contains the full analysis, code, and deliverables for my BMIN 5030 Data Science Final Project. The project evaluates whether a structured pediatric Headache SmartForm—used across a large pediatric primary care network—can reliably identify children who need primary care management, a standard neurology referral, or an expedited neurology referral.

Using a dataset of 1,451 headache encounters, I constructed a weighted red-flag scoring system from SmartForm inputs, compared those score-based recommendations with actual provider referral behavior, and fit logistic regression models to assess which red-flag features predicted referral decisions and clinician concordance.
